            Description of Service
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The Bra Size Calculator is an online tool created to help women
            estimate their bra size based on basic measurements. It is designed
            to be quick, simple, and educational. The tool is provided for
            informational purposes only and does not replace professional
            fittings or medical advice.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-medium mb-4 mt-8">Use of Service</h2>

            You agree to use the tool responsibly and only for your own
            personal, non-commercial purposes. You must not reproduce, modify,
            sell, or distribute any part of the Service or its content without
            our prior written permission. Any misuse or unauthorized use of the
            website or tool may result in legal action.

          <p className="mb-4">
            We prioritize your privacy. Our tool does not collect, store, or
            transmit any information you input. All data stays within your
            browser session and is never saved on our servers. You can use the
            calculator confidently without worrying about your privacy being
            compromised.

            Accuracy and Limitations
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            While the calculator is designed to provide helpful estimates, it is
            not guaranteed to be 100% accurate. Every body is unique, and bra
            sizing can vary across brands and styles. The tool should be used as
            a general guide â€” for precise fitting, we recommend consulting a
            professional or trying on different sizes.
